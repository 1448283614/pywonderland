# Uniform tilings and automata of Coxeter groups

See the doc [here](http://pywonderland.com/uniform-tilings/).

TODO:

1. Implement snub tilings (not hard but I don't have much time).
2. 3d hyperbolic honeycombs acceleration.
3. Support using LaTeX symbols in svg output.
4. Fancy shader animations.
5. Hyperbolic honeycombs upper half space boundary images.
6. More helper utilities like drawing the automata in a more fancy style, drawing root graphs, cell galleys, etc.
